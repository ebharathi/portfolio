                    <p>My passion for computer science ignited when I entered college, when I started learning Javascript. By the end of first year, I was already a frontend developer. Not only did this give me valuable insights into my future career, but it also allowed me to earn through internships or part-time jobs. Although I wasn't officially hired due to my age, my determination led me to gain the experience I craved.</p>
                    <p>In India, computer education starts early, and I was no exception. I joined various computer-related clubs in school, including robotics, engineering basics, HTML, and game development. Through these clubs, I honed my coding skills, developed a strong foundation in math and science, and acquired essential skills in collaboration and leadership. I also gained in-depth knowledge of computer operating systems, hardware, and software.</p>
                    <p>Upon moving to America, I was surprised by the lack of such clubs in middle school. However, I rejoined the robotics club in 6th grade. Sadly, it didn't match my skill level, and I found myself helping my peers more than learning. In 7th grade, I stumbled upon "Girls Who Code," but it lacked the depth of programming I craved â€“ it was more about basic blocks and lighting up boards. Undeterred, I continued my personal studies. While others were dragging code blocks in Scratch, I was exploring Python libraries and reading Java books that my dad had given me.</p>
